    <div class = "description">
    <p> I wanted to present a typical story of a clique.
    Cliques always have a lead/ head who is self absorbed in their lives and don't care about anyone else unless they are trying to put them down.
    The ring leader is considered perfect in the eyes of everyone around them, but in reality, they have private problems with their lives.
    These hidden scars cause them to harm others.
    Their pains do not excuse the way they act.
    Each of these photos uniquely tell their own story and tell the same story.
    There are some with color, csome without color, and others are mixed with color and balck and white. </p>
